## About Our Club

Our club is a dynamic and collaborative space where creativity and innovation thrive. We believe in a structured approach, with a clear leadership structure comprised of a lead, co-lead, and two dedicated coordinators. This ensures efficient operations and smooth execution of our projects.

Our structure allows for both technical expertise and non-technical skills to come together, creating a well-rounded environment for everyone to contribute. With a focus on **Gen-AI** and **prompt engineering**, we are exploring the cutting-edge of technology, while also delving into areas like **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **web development**, and **cloud computing**.

On the non-technical side, our team is engaged in **public relations**, **event management**, and **creative design**, ensuring a cohesive and impactful message is delivered to the world. This structure not only enables us to achieve our goals but also fosters a spirit of teamwork and shared success.
